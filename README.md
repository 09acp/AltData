#### __Stage 1__

[] Create list of search terms

[] Data Wrangling
  [] Stemming
  [] Remove stop-words

[] PCA

[] DASH Visualization

#### Additional Ideas
- Better Term selection by processing STEAM comments / Company minutes / Filings
- Create regression models (RF, NLP) to predict intent behind search terms and assign to classes. (Better than simply volume)
